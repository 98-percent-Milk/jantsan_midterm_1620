            <p>
                <span>Mini-cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes? Which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?</span>
                <span>Our Cupcakes are better than cupcakes at Nibbles in Steamtown mall. Why? Because it comes in a sealed package; therefore, no one can put anything in it without you knowing.</span>
                <span>You might have seen our mascots in the street advertising our cupcakes. Our mascots are really hard to miss because it is a polar bear dressed as a cupcake.</span>
                <span>And I would do anything for cupcake. I'd run right into hell and back. I would do anything for cupcake. I'd never lie to you and that's a fact. But I'll never forget the way you feel right now.</span>
                <span>Oh no, no way. And I would do anything for cupcake. Oh I would do anything for cupcake. I would do anything for cupcake, but I won't do that. No, I won't do that.</span>
